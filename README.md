bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define the `API_BASE_URL` to point to your backend server.
```env
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## About
A job platform built with Nuxt.js, providing features for job postings and user permission access. Users can create, update, and view job listings.

## Features

- **Job Listings**: Users can browse and view job postings.
- **Create/Edit Job**: Users can create and update job listings.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality with token-based authentication.
    > ðŸ›‚ **Note:** To log in, please use a **username** and **password** created from the backend Django admin panel.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js (Vue 3)
- **State Management**: Pinia (Vuex alternative)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

- **pages/**: Vue components for different pages (e.g., job listings, job detail).
- **composables/**: Reusable fetch request (e.g., header, job cards).
- **store/**: Pinia state management for frontend state.


## Assumptions and Design Decisions
This was my first time working with the Nuxt framework, so the development process took longer than expected. Given the minimal scope of the project, I chose not to implement full user management (e.g., registration, profile editing). Instead, I focused solely on basic `JWT` authentication with login, logout, and token refresh logic.

The UI/UX was designed from the perspective of an internal platform administrator, so I used `/dashboard` as the main route instead of `/jobs`. The dashboard directly displays the job table, which serves as the primary management interface. Due to limited development time, I opted for a simple layout without breaking components into reusable modules. The priority was to showcase the backend features, not frontend architecture.

For the search functionality, I initially considered using multi-select inputs for `status`, `related_skills`, and `location`. However, implementing that would have required additional API endpoints to fetch the full list of available filter values, which felt out of scope for a project of this scaleâ€”so I chose not to pursue it.

As the task instructed that the `company_name` field should not be editable during job updates, I removed that field from the update payload entirely. I also added client-side validation for date logic, ensuring `posting_date` < `expiration_date`. The validation deliberately allows past expiration dates, as this can be intentional in real-world business cases (e.g., backdating or archiving logic).

The `salary_range` field does not include any validation either, since in real job platforms the formatting is highly variedâ€”some may input ranges, others might list single values or notes like "negotiable". For this reason, filtering is implemented as simple text search only.

Finally, I had planned to use `@nuxtjs/i18n` to support multilingual interface switching between Chinese and English. However, I realized that only translating static platform text without translating job content would feel incomplete. Implementing full content-level `i18n` would have significantly increased the development time, so I decided not to move forward with it for this version.
